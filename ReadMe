Project Title:
ETL Pipeline from MongoDB to SQL Server Using Python

Project Description:
In this project, I developed an ETL pipeline using Python to seamlessly transfer data from several MongoDB collections to a SQL Server database. 

The process involves extracting data from various MongoDB collections, handling nested structures by flattening them, transforming the data into SQL-compatible formats, and loading the cleaned 
and structured data into the SQL Server. 

This automation ensures efficient data migration and transformation, leveraging Prefect for workflow orchestration and ensuring that complex data engineering tasks are executed reliably and repeatably. 

The use of Python libraries such as Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and PyMongo underscores the project's robust and scalable approach to managing large datasets.
